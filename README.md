The project is a simple RESTful API developed in Go, serving as an introduction to Go programming. It provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a "todo" list, allowing users to retrieve all todos, add a new todo, retrieve a specific todo by ID, and toggle the completion status of a todo. The primary purpose is to showcase fundamental concepts in Go, such as routing, JSON handling, and basic error management in the context of a minimalistic todo list application.
